Welcome to the first of what will soon be many, blog posts.
 
My goal is to create a software development blog that allows me to learn and share topics in greater detail which will lead me to become a better developer. I plan on covering topics that include frontend/backend development, design, devlops, scripting, and everything in between.

Hopefully after this post, the articles will become a little more informative, and also include a few code snippets. Who doesn't love code snippets?

```java
//TODO: come up with awesome running code snippets
