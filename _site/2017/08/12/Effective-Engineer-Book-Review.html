The book went into detail about what you can and should be doing to elevate yourself from being just a regular, run-of-the-mill software engineer, to being an awesome effective engineer. The book is well written, very informative, and includes plenty of interesting case studies from companies (mainly located in Silicon Valley) that have run into problems and situations that most companies around the world face.<p>The book covers topics which include everything from how to better organize your tasks and goals, to explaining how you can grow your skill by mentoring and helping new hires. Other topics include; how to focus your time on the work that produces the best results (and explaining what ‘best results’ means), how to measure the work you have done so that you can spot improvements or issues early on, importance of automation, mastering your programming environment, and many others.<p>I think it is a good book that all engineers, no matter how much experience you have, should read (With that said, younger developers will take away a lot more from this book.) Too often I find myself or my coworkers with our heads down coding and not taking the time to step back and ask the right questions about whether we are even making a difference or not. Just because you were blindly asked to do a task, doesn’t mean that you can’t at least question why it needs to be done in the first place. More often that not, I find that if I keep asking questions about a new feature or task, I discover that the answers lead to a completely different solution or the feature may not even be needed. A perfect example is recently we have been working on migrating away from a legacy system and a lot of the features are being included in the new system without asking the question of “Does this add value?” Just because five years ago someone needed to spend hours working on a feature, doesn’t mean that it applies today. These are the types of situations that the author covers in the book and I feel give great insight on how to tackle the situations to create the best outcome for you and your company.<p>You can tell while reading through the book that the author has years of experience as a software engineer, and has spent a lot of time interviewing and researching how other engineers do their job. Most of the chapters consist of the author describing a problem, providing a solution, and then giving case studies or quotes from interviews that pertain to the subject. I particularly enjoyed the case studies that were paired with most topics. A lot of the case studies are of startup companies and the problems they face. Although I do not work at a startup, I feel that a lot of the points made throughout the book can be translated to any company. Some situations are not as easily translated in a large company, you might not have the ability to change the hiring process or dictate which languages and frameworks are used, but there are many different ways to make a difference. I feel the author does a good job of describing how you, no matter what your role, can start to make small differences that will eventually help you, and as a result, help others around you. Then once you are seen as an effective engineer, you will have a larger voice, and people will start turning to you more and more for your opinion and ideas, which will indirectly make them effective too.<p>I am constantly looking for ways to become a better engineer, and <em>The Effective Engineer</em> did just that. At the very least, it pushed me to finally start writing a blog. It also has helped me to question the tasks I do at work and how I go about doing them. Because of these reasons alone, I can’t help but recommend <em>The Effective Engineer</em> to every developer out there that wants to do better at their career (and who doesn’t want that?)</div><div class="share-page"> <span style="float: left;">Share this on &rarr;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-via="">Tweet</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');</script><div class="g-plus" data-action="share" data-annotation="bubble"></div><script src="https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js" async defer></script><div class="fb-share-button" data-href="http://localhost:4000/2017/08/12/Effective-Engineer-Book-Review.html" data-layout="button_count" style="position: relative; top: -8px; left: 3px;"></div></div><div id="fb-root"></div><script>(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.6&appId="; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script></div><div class="PageNavigation"> <a class="prev" href="/2017/08/05/SaltStack-plus-Docker.html">&laquo; SaltStack + Docker</a> <a class="next" href="/2017/08/26/Nodejs-server.html">Node.js + Express Generator &raquo;</a></div><div class="disqus-comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript"> /* <![CDATA[ */ var disqus_shortname = "dmcnavish"; var disqus_identifier = "http://localhost:4000_Effective Engineer Book Review"; var disqus_title = "Effective Engineer Book Review"; /* * * DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE * * */ (function() { var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true; dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js'; (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq); })(); /* ]]> */ </script></div><footer> &copy; Dave McNavish - <a href="https://github.com/dmcnavish">https://github.com/dmcnavish</a> - Powered by Jekyll.</footer></div></div><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-migrate-1.2.1.min.js"></script> <script src="/static/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script> <script src="/static/js/super-search.js"></script> <script src="/static/js/thickbox-compressed.js"></script> <script src="/static/js/projects.js"></script>
